    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      My culinary passion and profession spans several decades of education and
      work, but was propelled when I went to the French countryside of the Loire
      Valley and the Poitou-Charente to study with the late Chef Robert Reynolds
      of Le Trou Restaurant in San Francisco. Upon returning home to the Bay
      Area I received a degree in pastry and baking at the California Culinary
      Academy and returned to France again for an internship in pastry at Le
      Petit Prince in Sorgues, a small village near the famous wine region of
      Chateauneuf de Pape. I became pastry chef for Postino Restaurant in
      Lafayette after training at Tra Vigne in the Napa Valley under Chefs
      Michael Chiarello and Cat Cora, both currently with the Food Network.

      Eventually, I parted from restaurant work to pursue my love of cooking in
      France and Italy as well as a career in culinary education, and recipe
      testing for chef-authors. I tested recipes for and contributed to the
      celebrated Dean and Deluca Food and Wine Cookbook by Jeff Morgan and
      worked with Iron Chef Cat Cora on two cookbooks, Cat Cora’s Kitchen and
      Cooking from the Hip, among other book projects.  In between times I
      returned to Provence to work at Chateau Routas a sprawling vineyard and
      estate and worked for a summer as chef-manager of the property.

    <h2>About My Kitchen</h2>
    <p>
      My home-based cooking school, In Terry’s Kitchen, is located in the SF
      East Bay hills situated on a hilltop in Lafayette, California. A spacious
      well-equipped kitchen adjoins a large patio-garden with a wood burning
      Italian forno. A tree shaded staircase winds down to an expansive organic
      garden complete with hen house for six laying hens. Spectacular views
      reminiscent of Provence display a hillside studded with lavender and
      rosemary and California native oaks. The setting is a perfect tranquil
      environment for the specialty “hands on” classes, cooking parties, and
      demonstration classes offered throughout the year to enlighten students to
      the joy and pleasures of learning the art of cooking.
